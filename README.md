### This is my Piantor KMK setup.

***Notes:***
- The `code.py` files are purely for testing connections etc.  The "real" layouts are on `main.py`
- I'm currently working on training myself to move from a 6 column layout to a 5 column layout, so there are definitely some weirdly repeated keys in my layout as I gradually attempt to find a solution to successfully ween myself off of the outermost "pinky" columns.
